### Agronomy and Ecology


Ecology = study of natural systems (pure science)

Agronomy = study of agriculture (applied science)

Earliest combination 
- "crop ecology" (1920s)
- where crops were grown and their optimal 
ecological conditions
– 1928; K.Klages; “Crop ecology & geography” 
– 1939; H.Hanson; “Ecology in agriculture’

Early agriculture defined by fertilizer limitation
- Von Leibig vs. H

### Agriculture and Ecology Diverges

- WWII happens and a new process emerges for making explosives
- The Haber-Bosch process also happens to be good for fertilizer
– Ecology moved more into pure science direction
– Agronomy moved into mechanization and chemicals development

### Recombination

- Late 1950s; Maturing of the ecosystem concept in ecology prompted renewed
interest in crop ecology and a framework for examining agriculture
– 1956; G.Azzi; “Agricultural ecology” 
- 1960s and 1970s; environmental awareness
   - population & community ecology -> systems research 
   - 1962; R. Carson; Silent Spring
   - 1965; W. Tishcler; “Agrarokologie” (Agroecology)
   - 1973; D.H. Janzen; “Tropical agroecosystems”
   - 1977; O.L. Loucks; “Emergence of research on agroecosystems” 
   - 1979; G.Cox & M.Atkins; “Agricultural ecology"

### Agroecology as a Science, Movement, and Practice

- Agroecology simultaneously remerged as a 
   - distinct methodology for the study of agroecosystems
      - 1983; M. Alteri; “Agroecology”
      - 1984; R. Lowrance, et.al.; “Agricultural ecosystems: unifying concepts”
      - 1990; S. Gliessman; “Agroecology: researching the ecological basis for
      sustainable agriculture”
      - 1992; J. Vandemeer; “The Ecology of Intercropping”
      - 1995; Edens et al.; “Sustainable agriculture and integrated farming
      systems”
      - 1998; S. Gliessman; Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable
      Agriculture
   - social and political movement for food sovereighty
      - 2002;  T. Dalgaard, et.al.; “Agroecology, scaling, and 
      interdisciplinarity”
      - 2003; C. Francis, et.al.; “Agroecology: the ecology of food systems”
      - 2007; S. Gliessman; “Agroecology: the ecology of sustainable food
      systems


### Unified Framework for Agroecology

- Agroecology expanded as a strategy for global agroecosystems sustainability
- Food systems, rural development, and social responsibility
- 2009; Wezel et al
- 2016; Brym and Reeve
