title: Problem Decomposition
language: R
---

* Real computational tasks are complicated. 
* To accomplish them effectively you need to **think before you code**.

* Decompose a coding problem:
    1. Understand the problem.
        * Identify inputs and outputs.
    2. Break the problem down into a few pieces.
        * Build an outline on paper or as comments.
    3. Break those pieces into codeable chunks.
    4. Code one chunk at a time.

* Decompose a code chunk:
    1. Think about it.
    2. Write it.
    3. Test it ( *on it's own* ).
    4. Fix any problems.
