START WITH SOME SORT OF HOW ARE YOU USING LLMS SHARING/EXERCISE

### Problems with LLMs

- Energy
- Theft
- Reduced learning making it difficult to go from beginner to expert
- CHECK EARLIER LLM INTRO FOR MORE
- Incorrect code that can
  - Produce more confusion
  - Appear to give valid results that are wrong
  - Destroy things
  - Lead to compromised computers
- Cost
  - Start out with generous free plans
  - Most companies already increasing prices (and still losing money)
  - Expect costs to continue to rise

### Chat

- UF provides access to a number of different model's chat systems
- UF Navigator
- Navigate to: https://chat.ai.it.ufl.edu/
- Sign in

#### Improving output from LLMs

- Provide details (value of knowing things)
- Ask model to write code not return results
- Provide model with context
  - Better prompts
  - Attaching files
  - Including relevant urls
- If the resulting code doesn't, tell model what happened and ask for fixes
- This set of practices is so common they are now integrated into many IDEs

#### Improving learning with LLMs

- Learning mode

### Assistants

- "AI Coding Assistants" provide a combination of chat, autocomplete, and local code execution

#### Activating the assistant in Positron

- Click on ⚙️
- Choose `Settings`
- Type "Assistant"
- Scroll down and select `Enable`
- Restart Positron

#### Integrated Chat

- Click on the 🤖 (bottom of sidebar)
- _Type_ "How do I remove rows with na using dplyr"
- At pop-up allow access to GitHub Copilot Chat
- _Show at top of code block_
- From the top of code blocks you can
  - Run code in the console
  - Move code to the editor either in the current file or a new one
  - Copy it

#### Debugging

-

#### Autocomplete

#### Vide coding (agentic code development)

- Instead of writing code yourself with assitance from an LLM just have the LLM do all of the work
- Provide feedback to the LLM to make changes to the code
- Anyone have experience with this yet?

- "Using R create species distribution models for Great Egrets, White Ibis, and Roseatte Spoonbills. Use these models to make predictions for the distribution of those species in 26 years. Create a website displaying the current model predictions and the future predictions."
