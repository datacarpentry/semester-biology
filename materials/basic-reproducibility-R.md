title: Make Sure Code Runs
language: R
---

* Review important steps for making sure your code runs everywhere
* Important for class - your code has to run the on graders computer
* Important for science
    * next day (who has gotten code working & had it not work the next day?)
	* desktop vs. laptop
	* collaborators
	* advisor

### Make sure things you did before don't matter

* Change something
* Looks like it still works
* Only works because of something you did earlier in the same session

* Clear R environment using the broom icon on the `Environment` tab.
* Run entire file using `Source` button or `Ctrl-Shift-Enter`

### Make sure code works on other computers

* Don't use `setwd()`
* Use projects and relative paths
    * `data/mydata.csv` not `C:\Users\Batman\DataCarp\data\mydata.csv`
* Filenames in code should match actual names exactly, including capitalization

### Checklist

* There is an Assignment Turn In Checklist to help
* Show link on main page
