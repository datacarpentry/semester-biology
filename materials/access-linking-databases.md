Linking to Other Databases From Access
======================================

We often want to link Access with external databases.

We can do this to help manage multiple research projects on the same database:

* One database to hold the data
* One database for each project to hold the queries

This is also useful if we are sharing a common database hosted on a server.

1. In the **External Data** tab click on the desired database type in
the **Import & Link** section
2. Navigate to the database you want to connect to
3. If you only want to link to the database choose
**Link to the data source by creating a linked table**
4. Click **OK**
5. Select the tables you want to link to and click **OK**
6. The arrow next to the table indicate that it is a linked table
