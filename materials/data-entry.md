### Where to enter data

* Spreadsheet
* Text file
* Database
* Form (web or GUI databases)

* All of these are reasonable options
* When used properly spreadsheets or forms for databases can provide additional
protection against bad data being entered
* Be careful of data conversion issues from spreadsheets

### Quality Assurance

* Stopping bad data from ever being entered
* Let's us set rules about what values can be entered into a column

* Select an area of cells, most often a column
* `Data -> Data Validation`
* Choose the data type: `Whole numbers` (only that type can be entered)
* Set limitations
    * Use `Data` to set the type of limitation: `between` 
    * Then use additional boxes to provide specifics: `1` and `10`
* Add a message to explain what goes in a cell in `Input Message`
* Add a useful error message using `Error Alert

* Make lists of choices
    * `Allow` = `List`
    * Enter list values in `Sources`: DM, DO, DS, PP, PM

### Quality Control

* Looking for bad data that has already been entered
* Sort
* Graph
* Check for realistic ranges of values
