    """module docstring"""

    # imports
    # constants
    # classes
    # functions

    def main(...):
        ...

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

My approach
-----------
1. Modules for core functionality
2. Script with paper specific functions and commands
3. Command line interactions to allow control of the code
