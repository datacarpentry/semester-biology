### NOT Agroecology

Agroecology is NOT…

- resource-extracting mechanization of cropping systems.
- exclusively input and technology substitution.
- exclusively business-first development.
- unrestrained globalization of food systems.

### Enough Food

- Bad
   - How do we produce enough food?
- Better
   - How do we produce more with less? 
   - How do we produce more nutritious food? 
   - How do we produce more available food?

### Better Technology

- What are genetically modified organisms?
- What are the different ways you can genetically modify a crop plant?
- Are GMOs agroecology?
