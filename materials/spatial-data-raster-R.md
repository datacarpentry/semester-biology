### Introduction to raster data

* There are two common types of spatial data, raster and vector
* Raster data stores data that is continous across space
* Like climate variables, satellite imagery, and elevation
* It is stored in a gridded format

![Aerial photo of a green landscape.
A section of the landscape is expanded to show that it is composed of green pixels.
This is expanded to show that underlying the green pixels is a matrix of numerical values.
The matrix is then shown as green pixels again to represent plotting the raster.]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/raster_concept.png)

* In the grid each pixel contains a value
* So it is basically a matrix of numbers of one value at each position in the matrix
* So for elevation we would have a matrix of heights above sea level

### Importing and exploring

* We import raster data using the `rast()` function from the `terra` package
* We'll start by importing some elevation data collected from an airplane using an instrument called LIDAR
* One of the values that LIDAR can generate is a Digital Terrain Model or DTM, which is the elevation of the ground

```r
library(terra)

dtm_harv <- rast("data/harv/harv_dtmcrop.tif")
```

* Looking at this object provides information on the data it contains

```r
dtm_harv
```

* This is "metadata" or "data about "data"
* It is is important because it provides the context of spatial data this raster matrix so that R knows how to work with it


### Plotting spatial data with ggplot

* Spatial data can be plotted using either base R or `ggplot`
* We'll use `ggplot` since that's the data visualization tool we're using for this course
* Useful for making nice maps combined with other figures

* There is a special geom for plotting `terra` raster data `geom_spatraster`
* Since it is raster data it doesn't require an aesthetic

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyterra)

ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = dtm_harv)
```

* For spatial data we're going to put the data in the geom calls instead of `ggplot()` because we are often trying to combine data of different types from different objects into a single map

* We can change the color ramp by using `scale` functions
* This is equivalent to when we used `scale` to change the axes, but now we're changing the color ramp instead
* One good color ramp is "viridis"
* To use this color ramp we add `scale_fill_viridis_c() to our ggplot object
* We use `fill` because we are coloring the inside of each raster pixel (like the inside of a bar plot or histogram)
* The `_c` at the end indicates that it is a "continuous" scale

```r
ggplot() +
  geom_spatraster(data = dtm_harv) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c()
```

* If we had discrete data, e.g., on soil types, we would use `_d` instead
