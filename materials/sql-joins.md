### Basic join

* [`JOIN`](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp) 
    * combine rows from multiple tables
    * based on condition
  
```
SELECT year, month, day, genus, species
FROM surveys
JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id;
```
* This query selects `year`, `month`, and `day` from `surveys` and 
`genus` and `species` from the `species` table.
    * The query links the `species_id` from `surveys` with `species_id` from `species`.
* `ON` basically works like `WHERE`
    * It represents a matching identifier between two tables
    * In fact, you can even use `WHERE` instead
    * If you don't limit the join using `ON`, bad things happen, because the
      JOIN combines each row in `surveys` with every row in `species`

    ```
    SELECT year, month, day, genus, species
    FROM surveys
    JOIN species
    ```

*  Most standard uses of `JOIN` involve at least one variable that is a unique record.
    * `species.species_id` values are unique.
    * `surveys.species_id` values occur in multiple records.
    * So one way to think about this join is that it adds the information in
      `species_id` to the surveys table

### Multi-table join

* Use multiple `JOIN`s to link multiple tables.

```
SELECT year, month, day, genus, species, plot_type
FROM surveys
JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
JOIN plots ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id;
```

### Multi-table join with abbreviations

* The previous `SELECT` statement works because each of the fields are uniquely named.
* It is safer to write a query that links fields to their table. 

```
SELECT surveys.year, surveys.month, surveys.day, species.genus, 
species.species, plots.plot_type
FROM surveys
JOIN species ON surveys.species_id = species.species_id
JOIN plots ON surveys.plot_id = plots.plot_id;
```

* Use abbreviations to help with readability.

```
SELECT sv.year, sv.month, sv.day, sp.genus, sp.species, p.plot_type
FROM surveys sv
JOIN species sp  ON sv.species_id = sp.species_id
JOIN plots p ON sv.plot_id = p.plot_id;
```

### Combining joins with WHERE, ORDER BY, and aggregation

* Joins can be combined with everything else we've learned about SQL

```
SELECT sp.genus, sp.species, COUNT(*) as number
FROM surveys sv
JOIN species sp  ON sv.species_id = sp.species_id
JOIN plots p ON sv.plot_id = p.plot_id
WHERE p.plot_type = 'Rodent Exclosure'
GROUP BY sp.genus, sp.species
HAVING number > 50
ORDER BY number;
```

* To build of big queries like this start small and then expand
* Test each step
