### Understandable and reusable code

* Write code in understandable chunks.
* Write reusable code.
* Who has copy-pasted code a bunch of times to do different versions of the same thing?
* Who forgot to change something in one of them?
* Who had to make the same change to all of the copies?
* Functions are a chunk of code written to be reusable while changing the details

### Function basics

```r
function_name <- function(inputs) {
  output_value <- do_something(inputs)
  return(output_value)
}
```

* The braces indicate that the lines of code are a group that gets run together

```r
{a = 2
b = 3
a + b}
```

* Pressing run anywhere on the first line of this group runs all the lines in that group
* A function runs all of the lines of code in the braces
* Using the arguments provided
* And then returns the output

```r
calc_shrub_vol <- function(radius, height) {
  area <- pi * radius ^ 2
  volume <- area * height
  return(volume)
}
```

* Creating a function doesn't run it.
* Call the function with some arguments.

```r
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0)
```

* Store the output to use it later in the program

```r
shrub_vol <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0)
```

* Treat functions like they are isolated from the rest of the program
  * *Draw a box on board showing inputs->function->outputs*
  * The only things the function knows about are the inputs we pass it
  * The only thing the program knows about the function is the output it
    produces
  * If we have lots of functions we don't have to know what the other functions are doing to understand the one we are working on

* Walk through function execution (using debugger)
    * Call function
	* Assign 0.8 to `radius` and 2.0 to `height` inside function
	* Calculate the area and assign it to `area`
	* Calculate volume and assign it to `volume`
	* Send `volume` back as output
	* Store it in `shrub_vol`

* Treat functions like they are isolated
    * Can't access a variable that was created in a function
        * `> volume`
        * `Error: object 'volume' not found`
    * Or an argument by name
        * `> width`
        * `Error: object 'radius' not found`
    * 'Global' variables can influence function, but should not.
        * Very confusing and error prone to use a variable that isn't passed in
          as an argument
        * So inside a function only use variables that are arguments or created from the arguments

### Default arguments

* Defaults can be set for common inputs.
* Let's modify our function to round the output with a default number of digits of 2
* To do this add `=` and the default value after the variable name

```r
calc_shrub_vol <- function(radius, height, digits = 2) {
  area <- pi * radius ^ 2
  volume <- area * height
  volume_rounded <- round(volume, digits)
  return(volume_rounded)
}

calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0)
```

* Since we can choose whether to include the `digits` argument, arguments with defaults are called "optional arguments"
* If we do include them we can either include them positionally

```r
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0, 4)
```

* Or we can provide them by name

```r
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0, digits = 4)
```

> Do [Default Arguments]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-default-arguments-R).

> *Discuss why passing `a` and `b` in is more useful than having them fixed*

### Named vs unnamed arguments

* When to use or not use argument names

```r
calc_shrub_vol(radius = 0.8, height = 2.0, digits = 4)
```

Or

```r
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0, 4)
```

* You can always use names
    * Value gets assigned to variable of that name

```r
calc_shrub_vol(height = 2.0, digits = 4, radius = 0.8)
```

* If not using names then order determines naming
    * First value is `radius`, second value is `height`, third is `digits`

```r
calc_shrub_vol(2.0, 0.8, 4)
```

* If order is hard to remember use names
* In many cases there are *a lot* of optional arguments
    * Convention to always name optional argument
* So, in our case, the most common approach would be

```r
calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0, digits = 4)
```

### Combining Functions

* Each function should be single conceptual chunk of code
* Functions can be combined to do larger tasks in two ways

* Calling multiple functions in a row
* Using intermediate variables

```r
est_shrub_mass <- function(volume){
  mass <- 2.65 * volume ^ 0.9
}

shrub_volume <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, height = 2.0)
shrub_mass <- est_shrub_mass(shrub_volume)
```

* We can also use pipes with our own functions
* The output from the first function becomes the first argument for the second function

```r
shrub_mass <- calc_shrub_vol(0.8, 2.0) |>
  est_shrub_mass()
```

> Do [Combining Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-combining-functions-R).

* Can also call functions from inside other functions
* Allows organizing function calls into logical groups

```r
est_shrub_mass_dim <- function(radius, height){
  volume = calc_shrub_vol(radius, height)
  mass <- est_shrub_mass(volume)
  return(mass)
}

est_shrub_mass_dim(0.8, 2.0)
```

* We ***don't*** need to pass the function name into the function
* That's the one violation of the isolation rule

### Using dplyr & ggplot in functions

* There is an extra step we need to take when working with functions from dplyr and ggplot that work with "data variables", i.e., names of columns that are not in quotes
* These functions use tidy evaluation, a special type of non-standard evaluation
* This basically means they do fancy things under the surface to make them easier to work with
* But it means they don't work if we just pass things to functions in the most natural way

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

make_plot <- function(df, column, label) {
  ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = column)) +
    geom_histogram() +
    xlab(label)
}

surveys <- read_csv("surveys.csv")
make_plot(surveys, hindfoot_length, "Hindfoot Length [mm]")
```

* To fix this we have to tell our code which inputs/arguments are this special type of data variable
* We do this by "embracing" them in double braces

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)

make_plot <- function(df, column, label) {
{% raw %}ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = {{ column }})) +{% endraw %}
    geom_histogram() +
    xlab(label)
}

surveys <- read_csv("surveys.csv")
make_plot(surveys, hindfoot_length, "Hindfoot Length [mm]")
make_plot(surveys, weight, "Weight [g]")
```

* Only need to embrace column names that we are passing as arguments
* If we assume there is a column with some name in the data frame it doesn't need embracing

```r
library(tidyr)

create_time_series <- function(df, column){
    time_series <- df |>
      drop_na({{ column }}) |> # column is a variable for col name, needs brace
      group_by(year) |> # year is a column name in df, no brace
      summarize(avg_size = mean({{ column }}))
    return(time_series)
}

create_time_series(surveys, weight)
create_time_series(surveys, hindfoot_length)
```

### Code design with functions

* Functions let us break code up into logical chunks that can be understood in isolation
* Write functions at the top of your code then call them at the bottom
* The functions hold the details
* The function calls show you the outline of the code execution

```r
clean_data <- function(data){
  do_stuff(data)
}

process_data <- function(cleaned_data){
  do_dplyr_stuff(cleaned_data)
}

make_graph <- function(processed_data){
  do_ggplot_stuff(processed_data)
}

raw_data <- read_csv('mydata.csv')
cleaned_data <- clean_data(raw_data)
processed_data <- process_data(cleaned_data)
make_graph(processed_data)
```

### Documentation & Comments

* Documentation
    * How to use code
    * Use Roxygen comments for functions
* Comments
    * Why & how code works
    * Only if it code is confusing to read

### Working with functions in RStudio

* It is possible to find and jump between functions
* Click on list of functions at bottom of editor and select

* Can be helpful to clearly see what is a function
* Can have RStudio highlight them
*  Global Options -> Code -> Display -> Highlight R function calls
