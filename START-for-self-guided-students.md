### Step 1: Make sure we can help!

Check out the [target audience]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/audience) of the course and decide if you will benefit from interacting with these materials. If you are a scientists at any educational level that works with data and you 1) want to learn the basics of programming or 2) want to establish a little more formal programming background and work-flow, then you are likely our target audience. You can find a little more encouragement in our description of [why you should take this course]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-should-you-take-this-class/).

### Step 2: Decide your approach to the course.

As a self-guided student you can 1) follow along with the whole course at your own pace or 2) find a couple modules that will be helpful to you in isolation. 

1. If you are following the whole course, we suggest you follow the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule), which includes introductions into SQL and [R]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/why-r/). Each [assignment]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) includes listings for video and text materials, as well as the practice [exercises]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises). We provide output files with each exercise to give you a hint what your code should accomplish.

2. If you are interested in just a couple of modules in SQL or R, the best way to find out the assignment that is best suited to your needs is browsing through the [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule). 

*If you are interested in the Python material, the [lesson material]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials/) and [assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments/) developed in previous iterations of the course are still available, but with less direction.*

### Step 3: Setup your computer

Make sure your computer is [setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup).

### Step 4: Give us feedback

Help us make sure you have a good experience by [providing feedback]({{ site.github.repo }}/issues).
