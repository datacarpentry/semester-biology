This is a follow up to [Scientific 0]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Scientific-0-R).

Dr. Granger wants you to run an ANOVA to determine if the different experimental 
treatments lead to differences in shrub carbon.

1. Import the data and your results table that you exported in 'Combining 
   Basics'.
2. Do an ANOVA, using `aov()`, to determine if the experiment has an influence  
   on the shrub carbon and print out the results in a standard ANOVA table.
