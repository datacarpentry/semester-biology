title: Version Control 5
---

Add a docstring to the start of the `logistic_growth.py` file.

You're working late yourself and your a little annoyed at the contrived
nature of these version control problems, so you decide to add the
following docstring """Really lame fake program that unsuccessfully
attempts to simulate a problem that can be trivially solved using a
little math"""; Add the docstring and save your file. When you wake up
the next morning you realize that maybe this wasn't the smartest idea
you've had this week. Revert the change, add a better docstring, and
commit the change.
