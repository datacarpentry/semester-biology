This is a follow up to [Sexual Dimorophism Exploration]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Graphing-sexual-dimorphism-exploration-R).

Having done some basic visualization of the
[Lislevand et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1890/06-2054)
[dataset of bird size measures](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E088/096/avian_ssd_jan07.txt)
you realize that you'll need to do some data manipulation to really get at the
questions you want to answer.

1. In [Sexual Dimorophism Exploration]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Graphing-sexual-dimorphism-exploration-R)
you created a plot of the histograms of female and male masses by family. This
resulted in a lot of plots, but many of them had low sample sizes.

    The following code creates a data frame with a column of Family IDs and a
    column of the number of species in the associated family that have non-null
    masses for both males and females.


        large_n_families <- data %>%
          filter(!is.na(M_mass), !is.na(F_mass)) %>%
          group_by(Family) %>%
          summarize(num_species = n())


    Modify this code so that the resulting data frame only includes families
    with more than 25 species, and add a comment to the top of the block of code
    describing what it does.

    Now join this with your original data to get the subset of your data with more
    than 25 species in each family. `inner_join()` only keeps rows where the joining
    field(s) occur in both tables, so since you've already removed families without
    a lot of species from `large_n_families`, they will be removed from the resulting
    data frame.

    Now, remake your original graph using only the data on families with greater
    than 25 species.

2. Sexual size dimorphism doesn't seem to show up clearly when visually
   comparing the distributions of male and female masses across species. Maybe
   the differences among species are too large relative to the differences 
   between sexes to see what is happening; so, you decide to calculate the
   difference between male and female masses for each species and look at the
   distribution of those values for all species in the data.
   
   In the original data frame, use `mutate()` to create a new column which is the 
   relative size difference between female and male masses 

   `(F_mass - M_mass) / F_mass`

   and then make a single histogram that shows all of the species-level
   differences. Add a vertical line at 0 difference for reference.

3. Combine the two other tasks to produce histograms of the relative size
   difference for each family, only including families with more than 25
   species.

4. Save the figure from task 3 as a jpg file with the name `sexual_dimorphism_histogram.jpg`.
