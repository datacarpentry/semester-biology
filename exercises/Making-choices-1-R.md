Create the following variables.

```
w <- 10.2
x <- 1.3
y <- 2.8
z <- 17.5
dna1 <- "attattaggaccaca"
dna2 <- "attattaggaacaca"
```

Use them to print whether or not the following statements are 

`TRUE` or `FALSE`.

1. `w` is greater than 10
2. `w` + `x` is less than 15
3. `x` is greater than `y`
4.  2 * `x` + 0.2 is equal to `y`
5. `dna1` is the same as `dna2`
6. `dna1` is not the same as `dna2`
7. The number of occurrences of the base t is the same in `dna1` and `dna2`
8. `w` is greater than `x`, and `y` is greater than `z`
9. `x` times `w` is between 13.2 and 13.5
10. `dna1` is longer than 5 bases, or `z` is less than `w` * `x`
11. The combined length of `dna1` and `dna2` is greater than or equal to 30
12. (`w` + `x` + `y`) divided by the logarithm (base 10) of 100 is equal to 7.15
14. The GC content (*which is always a percentage*) of `dna1` is not the same as 
the GC content of `dna2`
