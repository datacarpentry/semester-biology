Write a program that uses a for loop to produce a list of the GC
contents of the following sequences (copy this list into your code):

```
sequences = ['GCTTACCCAA', 'gctaatta', 'CCTCTAGCGC', 'TAAATTTTGT', 'TGTGATACTG',
             'AACAGAGCATCTCTTGTGACCAGTT', 'TAGGCTGCCTGTGGCAGGTTGTTGCATTCTCTTAGAACCGCCCTGAACTC', 'ATCCACAGACATCTCGTGTAAGGGG',
             'CCCTCTTTCCAATTGACAGGATCAG', 'taggattgacctagaaa']

Print the list to the screen. Remember, the GC content is just the
number of G's plus the number of C's divided by the total number of
bases.

You may use a function if you wish, but it is not necessary.
