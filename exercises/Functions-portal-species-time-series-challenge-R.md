If [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172), [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483), and [plots.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474) are not available in your workspace download them:

Write a function that:

- Takes four arguments - 1) a data frame (where each row is one individual and there is a `genus` and a `species` column); 2) a column to use as a time column (e.g., `year`); 3) a `genus_name` argument for choosing which genus to plot; and 4) a `species_name` argument for choosing which species to plot.
- Makes a plot using `ggplot2` with the time on the x-axis, the `count` of the number of individuals (i.e., the number of rows) on the y-axis, and only plotting data for the species indicated by the `genus_name` and `species_name` arguments. The plot should display the data as blue points (with size = 2) connected by blue lines (with linewidth = 1). Make y-axis label `Number of Individuals`.

1. Use your function, and the data in `surveys.csv` and `species.csv`, to plot the time-series for `time` = `year`, `genus_name` = `"Dipodomys"` and `species_name` = `"merriami"`
2. Use your function, and the data in `surveys.csv` and `species.csv`, to plot the time-series for `time` = `month`, `genus_name` = `"Chaetodipus"` and `species_name` = `"penicillatus"` (this plot will show the average seasonal pattern of _Chaetodipus penicillatus_ abundances)
3. Use your function, and the data from `plots.csv`, `surveys.csv` and `species.csv`, to plot the time-series for `time` = `year`, `genus_name` = `"Chaetodipus"` and `species_name` = `"baileyi"` only on the `"Control"` plots.
