Write a query that returns the number of individuals of each species
captured in each year and the total biomass of those individuals (the
sum of the wgt column). The units for biomass should be in kilograms.
Include the year and species ID in the output. Sort the result
chronologically by year and then alphabetically by species. Save as
`Mass-Abundance Data`.
