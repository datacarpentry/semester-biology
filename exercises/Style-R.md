Programming computers to do cool science is a major advantage for modern scientists. But, developing research programs that are transparent, collaborative and reproducible is a major advantage for science. All data scientists can contribute to this goal by writing their code in easily readable, well described, and well commented scripts.

This was not the case for the hack that wrote [this script]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/magic-8-ballBADstyle-R.R) to simulate a [Magic 8 Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball). *It works, but it's UGLY!* 
- Download [the script]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/magic-8-ballBADstyle-R.R) 
- Take a minute to understand what is going on.
- Modify the code so that it works and reads with clear style.
