Add a comment to the start of the `logistic_growth.R` file.

You're working late yourself and your a little annoyed at the contrived
nature of these version control problems, so you decide to add the
following comment 

```### Really lame fake program that unsuccessfully
attempts to simulate a problem that can be trivially solved using a
little math``` 

Add the comment and save your file. When you wake up the next morning you 
realize that maybe this wasn't the smartest idea you've had this week. Revert 
the change, add a better comment, and commit the change.
