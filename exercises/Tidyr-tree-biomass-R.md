Estimating the total amount of biomass (*the total mass of all individuals*) 
in forests is important for understanding the global carbon budget and how the 
earth will respond to increases in carbon dioxide emissions. Measuring the mass 
of whole trees is a major effort and requires destructive harvest of the tree. 
Fortunately, we can estimate the mass of a tree based on its diameter.

There are lots of equations for estimating the mass of a tree from its diameter, 
but one good option is the equation: 
    
Mass = 0.124 * Diameter<sup>2.53</sup>

where `Mass` is measured in kg of dry above-ground biomass and
`Diameter` is in cm
[DBH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_at_breast_height)
([Brown 1997](http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4095E/W4095E00.htm)).

We're going to estimate the total tree biomass for trees in a 96
hectare area of the Western Ghats in India.
[The raw data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/216/Macroplot_data_Rev.txt)
is available on
[Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/Archive/).
Unfortunately, the data is stored in a poor database structure and
using all of the tree stems would be difficult without first tidying
up the data. You can have a look at
[the metadata](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E091/216/metadata.htm)
to get familiar with the data structure.

1. Use `tidyr` to `gather()` the raw data into rows for each measured stem. 
2. Write a function that takes a vector of tree diameters as an argument and   
   returns a vector of tree masses.
3. Stems are measured in girth (*or circumference*) rather than diameter.
   Write a function that takes a vector of circumferences as an argument
   and returns a vector of diameters (*circumference = pi \* diameter*).
4. Use the two functions you've written to estimate the total biomass (*i.e., 
   the sum of the masses*) of trees in this dataset and print the result to the
   screen.
5. `separate()` the `SpCode` into `GenusCode` and `SpEpCode` and
   estimate the total biomass per genus in a table. *Technically the
   four letter code doesn't uniquely identify all of the genera in the
   dataset, but we'll assume it does for the purpose of this
   exercise.*
