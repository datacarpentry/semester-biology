You are interested in understanding how the biodiversity of birds varies in
response to environmental variables and decide to conduct your analysis in a
reproducible manner using `knitr` and `rmarkdown`. Specifically you want to know
how species richness (the number of species seen at a site) varies in response
to the mean annual temperature and the mean annaual precipitation.

1. Start a new `Rmd` document with a title and author and set the output format
   to `html_document`.
2. Add a markdown chunk that describes the question you are going to ask.
3. Add a code chunk that loads the required packages. Hide the output from
   loading packages using `message = FALSE`.
4. Add a header related to downloading and importing the data.
5. Add a text section briefly describing the two datasets you are going to use.
6. Add a code chunk to download the Breeding Bird Survey data using the
   `rdataretriever` package. Instructions for installing this package and the
   associated Python package are available on the
   [Data Retriever website](https://retriever.readthedocs.io). It will take a
   long time to download and convert this data into a set of useable CSV files
   (~30 minutes), so add a conditional statement that checks to see if the
   necessary files have already been created and only install they data if they
   have not. Don't show the output for this chunk.
7. Add a code chunk to load the species, counts, and routes tables into R and
   display the top few rows of each table.
8. Make a map of the locations of all of the Breeding Bird Survey routes,
   including an outline the North America landmass. Add a header above this map
   describing what it shows. You can get a world map useing
   `usmap = map_data("world")`, which you can then plot using `geom_polygon`.
   To only show this data in the region of the Breeding Bird Survey routes add
   the following to you `ggplot` command:

   ```
   scale_x_continuous(limits = c(min(routes$longitude), max(routes$longitude))) +
   scale_y_continuous(limits = c(min(routes$latitude), max(routes$latitude)))
   ```

9. Use the `getData` function from the `raster` package to obtain the bioclim
   data (`getData('worldclim', var = 'bio', res = 10)`) and `extract` the values
   for each route. Convert resulting matrix into a data frame and `select` just
   the mean annual temperature (bio1) and the mean annual precipitation (bio1).
   Use `cbind` to combine these two predictor columns with the routes table.
10. Determine the species richness at each route in 2015. To get unique routes
   you will need to group by by the `statenum` and `route` columns. Join this
   data with the predictor data you obtained in (7).Display the new table data.
11. Make two graphs, one each showing the relationship between `bio1` and
   `richness` and `bio12` and `richness`. Include the raw data points and a
   smooth line through them. (*optional*) Try doing this with a function if you
   want an extra challenge.
12. Write a brief conclusions section providing your interpretation of the
    results.
13. Return to the data section of your document and add citations for both
    datasets. You will need to create a `.bib` file to hold your bibtex
    citations. You can obtain bibtex for the citations by searching Google
    Scholar for "Breeding Bird Survey" and "Worldclim", clicking on the `"`
    icon, and selecting `bibtex`. You should also add a `References` header at
    the bottom of your document since the references will appear at the end.
