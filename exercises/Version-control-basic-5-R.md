This is a follow up to
[Version Control Basic 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-4-R).

Dr. Granger contacts you and lets you know that she'd like to be able to see
what you've been doing and to share some more files with you. She's been
learning version control herself while on sabbatical and so she suggests that
you use a shared git repository on the hosting site [Github](https://github.com).

* Create an account on [Github](https://github.com)
* If you want to work in a public repository you can create one by clicking on
  the `+` button in the top right hand corner of the Github website. If you'd
  rather have a private repository for class, email your username to your
  professor and they will create a repository for you.
* Connect your local git repository to your remote repository on Github
    * Click on the gear icon with the word `More` next to it and select `Shell`
    * Go to the Github webpage for your repository and copy the two lines of
    code under `push an existing repository from the command line`
    * Paste them into the Shell
	* Press enter
* Go back to the Github webpage for your repository and you should see your
  files
