A lot of real data isn't very tidy, mostly because most scientists aren't taught
about how to structure their data in a way that is easy to analyze.

[Download a messy version](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2252083)
of some of the Portal Project data. Note that there are multiple tabs in this
spreadsheet.

Think about what could be improved about this data. In a text file:

1-5\. Describe five things about this data that are not tidy and how you could
      fix each of those issues.

6\.   Could this data easily be imported into a database in its current form?

7\.   Do you think it's a good idea to enter the data like this and clean it up
      later, or to have a good data structure for analysis by the time data is
      being entered? Why?
