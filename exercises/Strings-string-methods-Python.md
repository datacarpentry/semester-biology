Use string methods to print the following strings. Remember that methods work by
adding the function to the end of the object name using a `.`, like

```
mystring = 'Hello World'
print mystring.lower()
```

1. `'species'` in all capital letters
2. `'gcagtctgaggattccaccttctacctgggagagaggacatactatatcgcagcagtggaggtggaatgg'`
    with all of the occurences of `'a'` replaced with `'A'`
3. `"    Thank goodness it's Friday"` without the leading white space
    (i.e., without the spaces before `"Thank"`)
4.  The number of `'a'`s in `'gccgatgtacatggaatatacttttcaggaaacacatatctgtggagagg'`.
