Create a new table in the Portal Mammals database called `field_notes`. The 
table should include information on the date of sampling that the notes apply 
to, *designed in such a way as to allow it to be linked to the main table*, and 
a large text field for entering notes.

*I would definitely recommend using VARCHAR for the notes field because you have 
no idea how extensive future notes might be and the notes will probably vary 
wildly in length*.
