Write a function that prints:

The ultimate answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and
everything is: XXX.

Where XXX is either a string or a number that is passed to the function
as a parameter. **Use a format string to accomplish this.** Use this
function to print out the answer if the input parameter is 42, but
**don't actually do the printing from inside the function**(think about
why printing from outside the function might generally be more useful).

*If you don't understand why this question is fun/funny you can Google
it or, better yet, actually read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which
is one of the funniest books ever written. There is also a very valuable
programming lesson to this story.*
