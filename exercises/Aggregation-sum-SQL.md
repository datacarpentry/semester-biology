Write a query that returns the number of individuals of each species
captured in each year (`total_abundance`) and the `total_biomass` of those 
individuals (*the sum of the `weight`*). The units for biomass should be in 
kilograms. Include the `year` and `species_id` in the output. Sort the result
chronologically by year and then alphabetically by species. Save as
`mass_abundance_data`.
