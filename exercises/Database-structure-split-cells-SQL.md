The original Portal `Species` table is also messy. [Download it]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/Portal-species-original.csv)
and import it into the `portal_mammals_original.sqlite` database. Again,
 
**Before starting this problem make sure that you have a backup of your database** In general, when developing a database it's probably 
best to work on a copy that is specifically just for development. Once it's working then apply it to your actual database. *Always, always, backup your databases before messing with them in this manner. 
**Seriously.***

The `Species` table in the Portal database has a structural problem in that the
`oldcode` column often contains multiple pieces of information in a single
cell. This means that we can't really run queries that use the `oldcode` field
effectively. Think about what the best structure would be for this table. It
might include splitting the table into two separate tables (*wink, wink, nudge,
nudge*). Restructure the database and store the new species table as
`PortalMammal_species`(*i.e., the same name it has now; you may need to learn
about the [DROP TABLE](http://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_drop.asp) command in
order to do this*) and naming any new tables you create with easy to understand
names.
