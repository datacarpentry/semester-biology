title: Check That Your Code Runs

Sometimes you think you're code runs, but it only actually works because of something else you did previously. To make sure it actually runs you should save your work and then run it in a clean environment.

Follow these steps in RStudio to make sure your code really runs:

1\. Restart R (see above) by clicking `Session` in the menu bar and selecting `Restart R`:

2\. Check to make sure the `Environment` tab is empty:

3\. Rerun your entire homework assignment to make sure it runs from start to finish and produces the expected results.
