Dr. Granger is interested in studying the relationship between the
length of house-elves' ears and aspects of their DNA. This research is
part of a larger project attempting to understand why house-elves
possess such powerful magic. She has obtained DNA samples and ear
measurements from a small group of house-elves to conduct a preliminary
analysis (prior to submitting a grant application to the Ministry of
Magic) and she would like you to conduct the analysis for her (she might
know everything there is to know about magic, but she sure doesn't know
much about computers). She has placed the data in a file on the web for
you to [download]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/houseelf-earlength-dna-data.csv).

Write an R script that:

*  Imports the data
*  For each row in the dataset checks to see if the ear length is `"large"` (>10
   cm) or `"small"` (<=10 cm) and determines the GC-content of the DNA sequence
   (i.e., the percentage of bases that are either G or C)
*  Stores this information in a table where the first column has the ID for the
   individual, the second column contains the string `"large"` or the string
   `"small"` depending on the size of the individuals ears, and the third column
   contains the GC content of the DNA sequence.
*  Exports this table to a `csv` (*comma separated values*) file titled
   `grangers_analysis.csv`.
*  Prints the average GC-contents for large-eared elves and small-eared elves to
   the screen.

As you start to work on more complex problems it's important to break them down
into manageable pieces. One natural way to break this list of things down is: 1)
import data; 2) determine size category; 3) determine GC-content; 4) calculate
the size category and GC-content for each row of data and store it; 5) export
this data to `csv`; 6) calculate and print the average GC-content for large and
small ears.

Use functions to break the code up into manageable pieces. Remember to document
your code well.

There are several different specific approaches you could take to doing
calculations for each row of data. One is to use `dplyr` using the `rowwise()`
function
([here's an example](http://www.expressivecode.org/2014/12/17/mutating-using-functions-in-dplyr/)).
Another is to loop over the rows in the data.frame using

`for (row in 1:nrow(data)){...}`

A third is to break the `data.frame` into vectors and use `sapply()`.

Ask your instructor if you have questions about the best choices.
