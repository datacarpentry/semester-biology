This is a follow up to [Writing Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-writing-functions-R).

Measuring things using the metric system is great for us scientists, but
when you call your grandmother this weekend (*you do call your
grandmother every weekend don't you?*) you'd like to tell her that you're
taking this awesome class where you learned how to program a computer to
calculate how much dinosaurs weigh (*if you phrase it like this she'll
have something really cool to brag about to her friends*), and that you
calculated the weight of a Stegosaurus (*no need to scare grandma by
talking about the totally awesome, and really scary, Spinosaurus*). The
problem is that your grandmother doesn't really know what a kilogram is,
she wants to know what it weighed in pounds. So, hook your grandmother
up and write a function that converts kilograms into pounds. Use that
function along with your dinosaur mass function to estimate the weight,
in pounds, of a 12 m long Stegosaurus (*12 m is about as big as they come
and we want grandma's story to to be as wild as possible*). In
*Stegosauria*, `a` has been estimated as `10.95` and `b` has been estimated as
`2.64` ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
