This is a follow up to [Use and Modify]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-use-and-modify-R).

Measuring things using the metric system is the standard approach for
scientists, but when communicating your results more broadly it may be
useful to use different units (at least in some countries). Write a function
that converts kilograms into pounds (there are 2.205 pounds in a kilogram). Use
that function along with your dinosaur mass function
from [Use and Modify]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-use-and-modify-R)
to estimate the weight, in pounds, of a 12 m long Stegosaurus (*12 m is about as
big as they come and nothing gets folks excited like a giant dinosaur*). In
*Stegosauria*, `a` has been estimated as `10.95` and `b` has been estimated as
`2.64` ([Seebacher 2001](http://www.jstor.org/stable/4524171)).
