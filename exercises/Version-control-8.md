title: Version Control 8
---

This is a follow up question to
[Version Control 7](/exercises/Version-control-7).

You're working late and you sit down to edit `predict_richness.sh`. You open the
file in your editor, reach for your cup of coffee, knock it over onto your
computer and in all of the excitement somehow delete the contents of the file
and save it (go ahead, open it, delete the contents, press save). Not to worry,
you're using version control. Take a deep breath, dry off your computer, revert
the changes using `git checkout`, and reflect on how using version control makes
you just like Superman in Superman 1 because it's like you made time go
backwards.
