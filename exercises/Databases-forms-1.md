Create a copy of the Portal Database by either copying a version you already
made or following the instructions in the [Joins 1 exercise](/exercises/Joins-1)
and create a basic data entry form for the species table. Since we would only
use this form to add new species to the table, do not include the OldCode field
in the form. Also, New Code isn't very clear for someone entering data, so
change the label on this field to Species Code. Save this form as `Species Table
Data Entry`.
