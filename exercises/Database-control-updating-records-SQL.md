Add the following note to the `FieldNotes` table in the Portal database
for the date `10`/`1`/`2015`:

`"Vegetation seems to have returned to normal for this time of year. The
landscape isn't exactly green, but there is a decent amount of plant
activity and there should be enough food for the rodents to the winter"`

As soon as you've added it you realized that this was the update for October 
2014, not October 2015. Update the record so that it contains the appropriate 
value.
