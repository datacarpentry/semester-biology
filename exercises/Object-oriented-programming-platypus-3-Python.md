We know that platypuses can lay up to three eggs each season. Starting
with the most basic assumption that each number of eggs is equally
likely (including zero), model the reproductive dynamics of a group of
three platypuses.

Create three Platypus objects, choosing a name and an initial number of
eggs for a season for each. Simulate 10 seasons worth of egg laying. For
each season for each platypus, randomly choose a number of eggs from
zero to three and add it to the list of the number of eggs laid. Once
the simulation is finished print out the name, total fecundity, and
number of breeding seasons for each platypus based on the following
example:

Billy laid a total of 10 eggs in 5 successful breeding seasons.
