Now that you've set up your GitHub repository for collaborating with your colleague
and made some changes, you'd better get them some work so they can see what
you're doing.

1. To look at the relationship between the length of each fish’s body and the size
   of its scale across the different lakes sampled in these data, create a 
   scatterplot with length on the x-axis and scalelength on the y-axis, then color the 
   points using lakeid. 
2. Commit this change.
3. Once you've committed the change click the `Push` button in the upper right
   corner of the window and then click `OK` when `git` is done pushing.
4. You should be able to see the changes you made on Github.
5. Email your teacher to let them know you've finished this exercise. Include in
   the email a link to your Github repository.
