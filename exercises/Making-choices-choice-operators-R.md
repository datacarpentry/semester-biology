Create the following variables.

```r
w <- 10.2
x <- 1.3
y <- 2.8
z <- 17.5
colors <- c("red", "blue", "green")
masses <- c(45.2, 36.1, 27.8, 81.6, 42.4)
dna1 <- "attattaggaccaca"
dna2 <- "attattaggaacaca"
```

Use them to print whether or not the following statements are `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

1. `w` is greater than 10
2. `"green"` is in `colors`
3. `x` is greater than `y`
4. Each value in `masses` is greater than 40.
5. 2 \* `x` + 0.2 is equal to `y`
6. `dna1` is the same as `dna2`
7. `dna1` is not the same as `dna2`
8. `w` is greater than `x`, or `y` is greater than `z`
9. `x` times `w` is between 13.2 and 13.5 (there is no way to indicated "between" in R so to do this we have to separately check if the number is greater than the minimum value and less than the maximum value, combining these two conditions with `&`)
10. Each mass in `masses` is between 30 and 50.
