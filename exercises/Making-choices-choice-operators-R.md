Create the following variables.

```
w <- 10.2
x <- 1.3
y <- 2.8
z <- 17.5
dna1 <- "attattaggaccaca"
dna2 <- "attattaggaacaca"
colors <- c("green", "pink", "red")
```

Use them to print whether or not the following statements are 

`TRUE` or `FALSE`.

1. `w` is greater than 10
2. `"green"` is in `colors`
3. `x` is greater than `y`
4.  2 * `x` + 0.2 is equal to `y`
5. `dna1` is the same as `dna2`
6. `dna1` is not the same as `dna2`
7. `w` is greater than `x`, and `y` is greater than `z`
8. `x` times `w` is between 13.2 and 13.5
9. `dna1` is longer than 5 bases (use `nchar()` to figure out how long a string
   is), or `z` is less than `w` * `x`
