Write a function to determine the GC-content of a DNA sequence and another
function to download this list of sequences from the web.
[Download the data](http://www.programmingforbiologists.org/sites/programmingforbiologists.org/files/dna_sequences.csv)
using your function and then use map() to calculate the value of the GC-content
for all of the sequences. Print the results to the screen.

If the imported data isn't in exactly the form you need it to be, you
might want to look at the difference between append and extend.
