This is a follow up to [Functions 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Functions-4-R).

Now that you've impressed Grandma, it's time to do some serious science.
Take the following vector of Stegosaur lengths

```
lengths <- c(10.1, 9.5, 11.2, 9.8, 10.4, 12.0, 11.5, 9.5, 9.8,
10.0, 10.7, 10.2, 11.9, 9.7, 11.2, 11.8, 10.7)
```

and estimate the mass in kilograms for each length using a `for` loop,
your function for estimating mass, `a = 10.95`, and `b = 2.64`. Print the
results in order.
