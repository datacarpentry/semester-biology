This is a follow up to
[First Solo Commit]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-first-solo-commit-R).

You discover that the device used to measure the scale length of the fish in `Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv` is not accurate for those smaller than 1 mm. Use dplyr to remove the fish with a scalelength of less than 1 mm from `fish_data_cat`. The new dataset will have 4,029 rows. 

Commit this change to version control with a good commit message.
