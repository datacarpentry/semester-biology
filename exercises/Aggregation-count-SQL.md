Write a query that returns the number of individuals identified to species in each year (i.e., count the `species_id` column).
Name the count column `total_abundance` and sort it chronologically.
Include the year in the output.
Save it as `total_abundance_by_year`.
There should only be one value for each year since this is a count of the individuals across all species in that year.
