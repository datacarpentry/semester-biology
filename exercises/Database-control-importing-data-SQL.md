This example will walk you through how to get data that already exists
into SQLite.

1. Download the main table for
the
[Portal Project mammal database](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172). *It's
kind of large so it might take a few seconds*. The full database is available
on [GitHub](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) and updated monthly. We'll
use a simplified version in class.
2. Create a new database by clicking on `New Database` in the `Database` drop
down menu. Type `portal_mammals` for the name, click `OK` and choose where to
save the file.
3. Click on the `Import` icon.
4. Click on `Select File` and navigate to where you saved the data file
and select it.
5. Select `CSV`. *You can also import from SQL databases or modify the `Fields
separated` or `enclosed by`*. Make sure to select `First row contains column
names`.
6. Click `OK` when it asks if you want to modify the data.
7. Name the table that you are importing into `surveys`.
8. Identify the type for each field, using the `Data Type` drop-down menus. If
it is not obvious if the data type is an `INTEGER` or `VARCHAR` for each
variable, check the [metadata](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/metadata.htm). **Important: if you specify the wrong data type it
can cause some data to not be imported and/or prevent you from doing some kinds
of data manipulations.** â€‹
9. Select `recordID` as the `Primary Key` and click `OK`.
10. Click `OK` when asked if you are sure you want to import the data.
11. Now import the [plots](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474), and
    [species](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483) tables.
