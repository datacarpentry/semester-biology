This is a follow up to [Mammal Body Size by Continent]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Scientific-mammal-body-size-by-continent-R)
and [Mammal Body Size Distribution]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Graphing-mammal-body-size-distribution-R).

We have previously compared the average masses of extant and extinct species on
different continents to try to understand whether size has an influence on
extinction in mammals. We've done this by looking at the means and by comparing
the histograms for extinct and extant species, but we haven't done any
statistics yet to actually test if the average sizes are different.

Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the average sizes of the extinct and 
extant species in each continent.

Save the results as a `csv` file named `"size_comparison_results.csv"`, where 
the first column is the name of the continent, the second column is the average 
mass for the extant species, the third column is the average mass for the 
extinct species, and the fourth column is the p-value for whether or not they 
sare different.
