Install and familiarize yourself with the `dplyr` package. The `library()` step(s) should always be located at the very top of a script.

```
install.packages("dplyr")

library(dplyr)

help(package = dplyr)
```

This [vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) is a great reference for *data manipulation verbs* to keep in mind.
