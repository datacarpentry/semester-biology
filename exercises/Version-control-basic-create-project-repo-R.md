Set up a new GitHub repository for your class project in the class organization like you did in [Set Up Git]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-set-up-git-R/). This time name the repo `FirstnameLastnameProject`.

Commit and push your project proposal `.txt` file to your class project repo.
