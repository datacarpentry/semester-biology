Let's access an SQL database directly from R using `dplyr`.

Either use an existing copy of the `portal_mammals.sqlite` database or [download
a new copy](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292171). You
should be able to link to the `surveys` table in the database using:

```
portaldb <- src_sqlite("portal_mammals.sqlite")
surveys <- tbl(portaldb, "surveys")
```

`surveys` will be a `tbl_sqlite`, which means that the table remains external to 
the R environment. *Also, we won't need to worry about it printing out huge 
numbers of rows when we look at it.*

1. Use the `nrow()` function to determine how many records are represented in
   `surveys`.
2. Select the `year`, `month`, `day`, and `species_id` columns in that order.
3. Create a new data frame with the `year`, `species_id`, and weight in
   kilograms of each individual, with no null weights.
4. Use the `distinct()` function to print the `species_id` for each
   species in the dataset that has been weighed.
