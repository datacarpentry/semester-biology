Create the following variables:

```
w = 10.2
x = 1.3
y = 2.8
z = 17.5
dna1 = 'attattaggaccaca'
dna2 = 'attattaggaacaca'
species1 = 'diplodocus'
species2 = 'tyrannosaurus'
```

Use them to print whether or not the following statements are 

`True` or `False`:

1.  `w` is greater than 10
2.  `w` + `x` is less than 15
3.  `x` is greater than `y`
4.   2 * `x` + 0.2 is equal to `y`
5.  `dna1` is the same as `dna2`
6.  `dna1` is not the same as `dna2`
7.  The number of occurrences of the base t is the same in `dna1` and
    `dna2`
8.  `x` times `w` is between 13.2 and 13.5
9.  `species2` comes before `species1` alphabetically
10. `w` is greater than `x`, and `y` is greater than `z`
11. `dna1` is longer than 5 bases, or `z` is less than `w` * `x`,
    or both
12. The combined length of `dna1` and `dna2` is greater than or equal to 30
13. (`w` + `x` + `y`) divided by the logarithm (base 10) of 100 is
    equal to 7.15
14. The GC content (which is always a percentage) of `dna1` is not the
    same as the GC content of `dna2`
