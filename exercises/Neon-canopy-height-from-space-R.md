The [National Ecological Observatory Network](http://www.neonscience.org) has invested in [high-resolution airborne imaging](http://www.neonscience.org/data-resources/get-data/airborne-data) of their field sites. 
Elevation models generated from [LiDAR](http://neondataskills.org/self-paced-tutorial/1_About-LiDAR-Data-Light-Detection-and-Ranging_Activity1/) can be used to map the topography and vegetation structure at the sites.
This data gets really powerful when you can compare ecological processes across 
sites. 
[Download]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/NEON-airborne.zip) the elevation models for the [Harvard Forest](http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/) (`HARV`) and [San Joaquin Experimental Range](http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/ef/san_joaquin/) (`SJER`) 
and the plot locations for each of these sites. 
Often, plots within a site are used as representative samples of the larger site 
and act as reference areas to obtain more detailed information and ensure 
accuracy of satellite imagery (*i.e., ground truth*).

1. Create two [Canopy Height Models](http://neondataskills.org/R/Raster-Calculations-In-R/) using simple `raster` math (`chm = dsm - dtm`), one for the `HARV` site (which was done during the lecture) and another for the `SJER` site. 

2. Create plots and histograms of canopy heights for both of the sites on a single panel. To do so, type in the following line first to set up the panel: `par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 2))`. This specifies that there will be four figures on the same panel, and their margins. In the following lines, create the four plots using `plot()` and `hist()`. If you run these five lines together, they should create a 4-figured panel. 

3. Add corresponding points from `plot_locations` folder to each site plot. Don’t forget to use the `add = TRUE` argument to add one plot on top of another. If points don’t show up, compare the crs of the canopy height model and the plot locations. 

4. Create a single dataframe with two columns, one of the maximum canopy heights for each point at the `HARV` site and one for the `SJER` points’ maximum canopy heights. When extracting the canopy height values, use a buffer of 10.
