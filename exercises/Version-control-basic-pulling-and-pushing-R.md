This is a follow up to
[Pushing Changes]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Version-control-basic-pushing-changes-R).

**STOP: Wait until your teacher has told you they've updated your repository 
following the last exercise before doing this one.**

While you were working on your vectorized GC-content function, Dr. Granger (*who
has suddenly developed some pretty impressive computational skills*) has been
writing a ***vectorized ear length categorizer***. To get it you'll need to `pull` the
most recent changes from Github.

1. On the `Git` tab click on the `Pull` button with the blue arrow. You should
see some text that looks like:

   ```
   From github.com:ethanwhite/gryffindorforever
      1e24ac8..815e600  master     -> origin/master
   Updating 1e24ac8..815e600
   Fast-forward
    testme.txt | 1 +
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
   create mode 100644 youareawesome.txt
   ```

2. Click `OK`.
3. You should see the new function in your repository.

   ```
   get_size_class <- function(ear_length){
      # Calculate the size class for one or more earth lengths
      ear_lengths <- ifelse(ear_length > 10, "large", "small")
      return(ear_lengths)
   }
   ``` 

4. Write some new code that creates a data frame with information about the
  individual ID, the earth length class, and the gc-content for each individual.
5. Save this data frame as a csv file using `write.csv()`
6. Commit the new code and the resulting .CSV file and push the results to
  Github.
