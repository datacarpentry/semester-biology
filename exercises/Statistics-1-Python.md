This is a follow up to [Graphing 3]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises/Graphing-3-Python).

We've graphed the relationship between adult size and new born size in
mammals and now it's time to analyze the relationship statistically.

1.  Do a regression where x is log10(adult mass) and y is log10(newborn
    mass)
2.  Print the summary statistics for this regression
3.  Make a graph that shows both the data points and the regression line through
    those points. Label the axes

*Optional: If you want, plot a histogram of the residuals of the regression to
make sure that they are roughly normally distributed (you can do this with just
a single line of code)*
