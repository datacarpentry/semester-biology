[Forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) using [GitHub](http://github.com) generates a copy of the repository at `https://yourusername.github.io/semester-biology`.

- Follow the [steps provided by GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to fork the repository.

- Activate the `Issues` feature from [your repository `Settings` tab]({{ site.github.repo }}/settings). *The site links to `New Issues` as one option 
for student and collaborator communication. It is also a great way to organize 
any work that needs to be done on your site.* 

- `git clone` the forked version of the repository onto your local machine.

- Get started [customizing]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/course-customization) and [managing]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/manage-files) your version of the course.

- From your local repository, you can also [contribute back]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/contributing) to our master repository.
