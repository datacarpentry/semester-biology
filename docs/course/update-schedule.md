- Find and open the `schedule.md` file in the main directory.

- The majority of the page content is generated automatically by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
and should be left AS IS. All you need to change is the list of `assignments:` 
in the YAML front matter section. List the page `title` found in the YAML of 
assignment files from the `assignments/` directory. Here's how to [add and 
modify assignments]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/manage-assignments).

- Add, commit, and push the new file to GitHub to get the content added to the website. These steps are further described in [Course Customization Help]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course-customization).
