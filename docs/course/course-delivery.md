### Flipped Classroom

In a Flipped Classroom, students are assigned [`readings/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings) prior to class with a focus on [`exercises/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises) and [`assignments/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) in class. [`lectures/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures) are  brief and serve to motivate the 
activity for the class. This course uses a flipped, learner-centered, approach 
because learning to program is most effective when students are actively working 
with computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but they 
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. *Take a look at the great 
info-graphic below for more about the Flipped Classroom approach.* 


### Workshop In-class Format

While this course is designed as a flipped classroom, some motivation and re-
exposure to the ideas from the [`readings/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/readings) is 
beneficial. In some cases, multiple key topics are more effectively introduced 
separately, where a brief introduction to one of the key topics is followed by 
the students completing an [`exercise`]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercises) on that topic. Depending on the length of the [`assignment`]({{ site.baseurl }}/assignments) and class session this could be repeated 2-3 times to cover that many key topics. Recommended structure for this strategy is included for R and SQL lessons in [`lectures/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/lectures) and [`materials/`]({{ site.baseurl }}/materials).
