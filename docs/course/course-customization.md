### Simple setup

The website is setup to be easy to run automatically through GitHub:

1. [Fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/forking-the-course) 
   or [import](https://import.github.com/) the repository
   * In a few minutes you should be able to see the site at:
     `https://yourusername.github.io/semester-biology/`
2. [Add or Edit]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/manage-files) any of the Markdown (`.MD`) files
3. Commit and push the changes
   * The changes should now be reflected on the website
4. If you want to use a custom domain name instead of `github.io`, follow
   [GitHub's instructions for setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

If you have any problems please [let us know]({{ site.github.repo}}/issues/new) 
and we'll be happy to help.
