The website is setup to be easy to run automatically through [GitHub](http://github.com):

- [Fork]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/forking-the-course) 
   or [import](https://import.github.com/) the repository
   - In a few minutes you should be able to see a copy of the site at:
     `https://yourusername.github.io/semester-biology/`
   - If you want to use a custom domain name instead of `github.io`, follow
      [GitHub's instructions for setting up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).

- [Add or Edit]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/course/manage-files) any of the course content files. In particular, you will be interested to update:
  - course description in `index.md` in the main directory
  - course details and policy in `syllabus.md` in the main directory
  - `# Setup` information in `_config.yml` in the main directory
  - `assignments:` list in the `schedule.md` front matter
  - motivation and support documents in `about/`
  - software download and install in `computer-setup.md`

- If you have any problems please [let us know]({{ site.github.repo}}/issues/new) and we'll be happy to help.
