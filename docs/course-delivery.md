### Flipped Classroom

In a Flipped Classroom, students are assigned `readings/` prior to class with a 
focus on `exercises/` and `assignments/` in class. `lectures/` are  brief and 
serve to motivate the activity for the class. This course uses a flipped, 
learner-centered, approach because learning to program is most effective when 
students are actively working with computers. Flipped classes work well for all 
kinds of content, but they work particularly well for computer oriented classes. 
*Take a look at the great info-graphic below for more about the Flipped 
Classroom approach.* 


### Workshop In-class Format

While this course is designed as a flipped classroom, some motivation and re-
exposure to the ideas from the `readings/` is beneficial. In some cases, 
multiple key topics are more effectively introduced separately, where a brief 
introduction to one of the key topics is followed by the students completing an 
`exercise/` on that topic. Depending on the length of the `assignments/` and 
class session this could be repeated 2-3 times to cover that many key topics. 
Recommended structure for this strategy is included for R and SQL lessons in 
`lectures/` and `materials/`.
