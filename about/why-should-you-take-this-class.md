title: Why should you take this class?
---

Because [biology students really need to know how to
program](http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/03/why-biology-students-should-learn-how-to-program/).

Because it's [quantifiably
worthwhile](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2011/06/doing-the-math.html) for a
scientist to learn how to program well.

Because [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/) says so:

And because [students really like it]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/praise).
