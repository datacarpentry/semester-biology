title: Flipped Classes
---

I use a flipped, learner-centered, approach to teaching both of
these classes, because I think that learning to program has very little
to do with me talking and a lot to do with students working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I
think they work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If
you're interested in knowing more take a look at this great
info-graphic:
