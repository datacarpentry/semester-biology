Computers are increasingly essential to the study of all aspects
of biology. Basic computer programming is now required for everything from
accessing and managing data, to statistical analysis, to simulation and
numerical modeling. This course will provide an introduction to programming
targeted towards biologists, and will take a student-centered, active learning,
approach to teaching this material. Class will typically consist of a short
introductions to programming techniques and associated biological problems,
followed by hands on computing exercises. The course will be taught using
Python. No programming background is required.
