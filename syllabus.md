### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Many classes will
typically start with 5-10 minutes of either reviewing parts of this material or
answering student questions about it. The rest of the class period will be used
to work on exercises. During this time the instructor will actively engage with
students to help them understand material they find confusing, explain
misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that are preventing students from
from accomplishing the exercises, and discuss novel applications and alternative
approaches to the data analysis challenges students are attempting to solve. For
more challenging topics class may start with 20-30 minute demonstrations on the
concepts followed by time to work on exercises.
