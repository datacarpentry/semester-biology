### Required Texts

There is no required text book for this class.

All needed material is openly available on the course website. If you are
interested in additional reading on the topics we are covering I highly
recommend [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), which is freely
available on the web.


### Course Description

An introduction to data management, manipulation, and analysis, with an emphasis
on biological problems. Class consists of short introductions to new concepts
followed by hands on computing exercises using R and SQLite, but the concepts
apply to programming languages and databases more generally. No background in
computing is required.


### Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills

Knowledge of basic biology to provide context for exercises.


### Purpose of Course

In this course you will learn all of the fundamental aspects of computer
programming that are necessary for conducting biological research. By the end of
the course you will be able to use these tools to import data into R, perform
analysis on that data, and export the results to graphs, text files, and
databases. By learning how to get the computer to do your work for you, you will
be able to do more science faster.


### Course Objectives and Goals

Students completing this course will be able to:

* Create well structured databases
* Extract information from databases
* Write computer programs in R
* Automate data analysis
* Apply these tools to address biological questions
* Apply general data management and analysis concepts to other programming
  languages and database management systems


### How this course relates to the Student Learning Outcomes in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation

This course contributes to the 'Quantitative Skills' and 'Conducting and
Analyzing Independent/Original Research' Student Learning Outcomes specified in
the
[Ph.D. and MS in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation Academic Assessment Plans](http://assessment.aa.ufl.edu/Data/Sites/22/media/2013-14gaap/cals/2013-14-cals-wildlife-ecol-and-consvn-phd-aap.pdf),
by providing students the skills and knowledge they need to manage and analyze
the data used in research.


### Teaching Philosophy

This class is taught using a flipped, learner-centered, approach, because
learning to program and work with data requires actively working on
computers. Flipped classes work well for all kinds of content, but I think they
work particularly well for computer oriented classes. If you're interested in
knowing more take a look at this great
[info-graphic](https://www.knewton.com/flipped-classroom-2/).


### Instructional Methods

As a flipped classroom, students are provided with either reading or video
material that they are expected to view/read prior to class. Classes will
involve brief refreshers on new concepts followed by working on exercises in
class that cover that concept. While students are working on exercises the
instructor will actively engage with students to help them understand material
they find confusing, explain misunderstandings and help identify mistakes that
are preventing students from completing the exercises, and discuss novel
applications and alternative approaches to the data analysis challenges students
are attempting to solve. For more challenging topics class may start with 20-30
minute demonstrations on the concepts followed by time to work on exercises.


## Course Policies


### Attendance Policy

Attendance will not be taken or factor into the grades for this class. However,
experience suggests that students who regularly miss class struggle to learn the
material.


### Quiz/Exam Policy

There are no quizzes or exams in this course.


### Make-up policy

Life happens and therefore there is an automatic grace period of 48 hours for
the submission of late assignments with no need to request an extension.
However, it is highly recommended that you submit assignments on time when
possible because assignments build on one another and it can be hard to catch up
if you fall behind. Reasonable requests for longer extensions will also be granted.
Assignments turned in after the 48 hour grace period without an extension will be
be graded with a 20% penalty.


### Assignment policy

Assignments are due Monday night by 11:59 pm Eastern Time. Assignments should be
submitted via Canvas. This timing allows you to be finished with one week's material
before starting the next week's material.


### Course Technology

Students are required to provide their own laptops and to install free and open
source software on those laptops (see [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/computer-setup)
for installation instructions). Support will be provided by the instructor in
the installation of required software. If you don't have access to a laptop
please contact the instructor and they will do their best to provide you with
one.


### Materials and Supplies Fees

There are no materials and supplies fees for this course.


## UF Policies


### University Policy on Accommodating Students with Disabilities

The Disability Resource Center coordinates the needed accommodations of students
with disabilities. This includes registering disabilities, recommending academic
accommodations within the classroom, accessing special adaptive computer
equipment, providing interpretation services and mediating faculty-student
disability related issues.Students requesting classroom accommodation must first
register with the Dean of Students Office. The Dean of Students Office will
provide documentation to the student who must then provide this documentation to
the Instructor when requesting accommodation0001 Reid Hall, 352-392-8565,
www.dso.ufl.edu/drc/

My policy: If you are in my class I want to help you learn and will happily work
with you to make the learning environment equitable for you and others.


### Online Course Evaluation Process

Student assessment of instruction is an important part of efforts to improve
teaching and learning. At the end of the semester, students are expectedto
provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course using a standard
set of university and college criteria. These evaluations are conducted online
at https://evaluations.ufl.edu. Evaluations are typically open for students to
complete during the last two or three weeks of the semester; students will be
notified of the specific times when they are open. Summary results of these
assessments are available to students at https://evaluations.ufl.edu/results. 


### University Policy on Academic Misconduct

Academic honesty and integrity are fundamental values of the University
community. Students should be sure that they understand the UF Student Honor
Code at http://www.dso.ufl.edu/students.php.


### Netiquette and Communication Courtesy

All members of the class are expected to follow rules of common
courtesy in all email messages, threaded discussions and chats.


### Academic Honesty

As a student at the University of Florida, you have committed yourself to uphold
the Honor Code, which includes the following pledge:“We, the members of the
University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the
highest standards of honesty and integrity.”You are expected to exhibit behavior
consistent with this commitment to the UF academic community, and on all work
submitted for credit at the University of Florida, the following pledge is
either required or implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received
unauthorized aid in doing this assignment."

It is assumed that you will complete all work independently in each course
unless the instructor provides explicit permission for you to collaborate on
course tasks (e.g. assignments, papers, quizzes, exams). Furthermore, as part of
your obligation to uphold the Honor Code, you should report any condition that
facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel. It is your individual
responsibility to know and comply with all university policies and procedures
regarding academic integrity and the Student Honor Code.Violations of the Honor
Code at the University of Florida will not be tolerated. Violations will be
reported to the Dean of Students Office for consideration of disciplinary
action. For more information regarding the Student Honor Code, please see:
http://www.dso.ufl.edu/sccr/process/student-conduct-honor-code


### Software Use

All faculty, staff and students of the university are required and expected to
obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use. Failure to do so can
lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the individual violator.
Because such violations are also against university policies and rules,
disciplinary action will be taken as appropriate.


### Student Privacy

There are federal laws protecting your privacy with regards to grades earned in
courses and on individual assignments.  For more information, please see:
http://registrar.ufl.edu/catalog0910/policies/regulationferpa.html
