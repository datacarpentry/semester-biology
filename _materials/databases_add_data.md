There are three ways to add data to database management systems

1. Enter the data directly
2. Enter the data into another program (e.g., a spreadsheet) and import it
3. Get the data from somewhere and import it (though as well learn in 2 weeks,
   the data isn't always ready to import into a database)

Demo:

1. Entering data directly into SQLite
   * Create weather table: RecordID(pk), JulianDay, Temp, Notes
   * Enter some data
2. Entering data directly in Access
3. Importing data into SQLite
   * Walk through of survey table import from homework
