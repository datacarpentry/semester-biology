title: Style Guide
---

We are, I hope, exiting an era in biological programming where the
majority of code is written for one time use by a single individual, and
entering an era of collaborative code development and publicly available
open source scientific code. For this to become a meaningful reality our
code needs to be readable and understandable by others. This requires
consistent formatting of code in the same way that good communication
requires proper formatting of text documents. Python has a recommended
style guide to facilitate consistent code formatting of both [the main
text](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [doc
strings](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). Participants in the
classroom courses are expected to follow these style guides and those
using this site are encouraged to do so in order to help improve the
scientific discourse that occurs through programming. The [Numpy
docstring
standards](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt)
are more stringent and considered by many to be the standard for
scientific software.
