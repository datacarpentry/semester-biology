From my reading of this traditional nursery rhyme, the fourth and fifth piggies 
could experience tough love. The fourth little piggy had no roast beef and there 
is nothing to suggest that the piggy was offered some, but refused it. It is 
unclear the reason the fifth piggy is crying. If it is upset, that is just tough 
for everyone going back home. Perhaps, though it is a giddy or playful cry.
