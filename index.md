This website hosts introductory material for teaching biologists how to interact
with data including: data structure, database management systems, and
programming for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. It is designed
to be used as a flipped university course and also to be useful for self-guided
students. Instructors are welcome to modify and use the material for your own 
courses. We encourage collaborative development and contributions by 
instructors, with the hopes that this will lead to better training and resources 
for everyone.
