This is a follow up to the [Executable Programs]({{site.baseurl}}/exercises/Shell-executable-programs-Python).

Now that you've gotten your bash script working locally you decided to
take it over to your groups server to do some serious analysis. Check
out your repository to a directory on the server. When the analysis is
finished change the name of the output file to
`predicted_diversities_server.txt` so that it doesn't overwrite your
other analysis. Commit the results.

Now, close the connection to the server and update the copy of your
repository on your own computer. You should see the new results sitting
there. Think to yourself, "Wow, version control really is awesome."
