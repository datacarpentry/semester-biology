You're working late and you sit down to edit `logistic_growth.py`. You
open the file in your editor, reach for your cup of coffee, knock it
over onto your computer and in all of the excitement somehow delete the
contents of the file and save it (go ahead, open it, delete the
contents, press save). Not to worry, you're using version control. Take
a deep breath, dry off your computer, revert the changes using
Subversion, and reflect on how using version control makes you just like
Superman in Superman 1 because it's like you made time go backwards.
