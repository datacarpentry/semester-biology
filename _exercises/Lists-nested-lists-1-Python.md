```
harry_potter_characters = [['Potter', 'Harry', 'Student'], ['Dobby',
'House Elf'], ['Granger', 'Hermione', 'Student'], ['Hagrid', 'Rubeus',
'Keeper of Keys and Grounds']]
```

Print the following lines with the the appropriate answers inserted into
the blanks by taking slices from the list:

1.  Harry ______________ is a ______________

    ______________ Â  ______________ who is
    typically refered to only by his last name.
3.  The entire entry in the table for Hagrid is

    [i.e., print out the sublist for Hagrid]
4.  Dobby is a ______________.
5.  ______________ Granger has a time-turner, which would
    be really useful for completing this homework.
