Programming computers to do cool science is a major advantage for modern scientists. But, developing research programs that are transparent, collaborative and reproducible is a major advantage for science. All data scientists can contribute to this goal by writing their code in easily readable, well described, and well commented scripts.

[This script]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/bad-style-R.R), which evaluates [tree composition in a Michigan swamp](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/251/default.htm), doesn't follow 
good style. *It works, but it's difficult to understand exactly what it is doing.* 

- Download [the script]({{ site.baseurl }}/code/bad-style-R.R). 
- Take a minute to understand what is going on.
- Modify the code so that it works and reads with clear style.
