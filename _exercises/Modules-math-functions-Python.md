Use the `sqrt()` and `log()` functions from the `math` module, along with the
built-in `round()` function to print the answers to the following questions to
the screen.

1.  How long is one side of a square plant census quadrat that has an
    area of 10 m^2, rounded to two decimal places?
2.  The number of species in a region can be estimated based on the area
    of that region using the equation: 

    `number of species = 3.5 + 0.25 * log(area)` 

    The logarithms in this equation are natural logarithms. What is the 
    estimated number of species for an area of 8 km^2 rounded to the nearest 
    integer.
