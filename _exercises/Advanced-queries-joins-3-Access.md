We want to do an analysis comparing the size of individuals on the
control plots to the Long-term Krat Exclosures. Write a query that
returns the year, species, weight and the `PlotTypeAlphaCode` for all cases
where the `PlotTypeDescript` is either Control or Long-term Krat
Exclosure. Save this query as `Size Comparison Controls vs. LT Krat
Exlosures`.
