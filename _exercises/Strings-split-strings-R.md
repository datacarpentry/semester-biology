You have a data file with a single `"taxonomy"` column in it. This column 
contains the family, genus, and species for a single taxonomic group. You need 
to figure out how to split that information into separate values for family, 
genus, and species. To solve the basic problem take a single example string,
`"Ornithorhynchidae Ornithorhynchus anatinus"`, split it into three separate
strings using a `stringr` command, and then print the family, genus, and species, each on a separate line.
