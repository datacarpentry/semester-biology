Using the Portal database write a query that returns the average number
of individuals per plot sampled each year on each of the different plot
types. In other words, we want to count up all of the individuals that
have been sampled on each type of plot in each year, and then divide
that number by the total number of plots with that plot type. You may be
able to reuse and/or modify some of the queries that you wrote earlier
in the assignment. If you modify a query make sure to save it under a
different name. Save the main query for this question as`Average Number
of Individuals By Plot Type and Year`.
