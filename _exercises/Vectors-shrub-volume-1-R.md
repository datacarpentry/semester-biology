You have data on the length, width, and height of the yew
[*Taxus baccata*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxus_baccata) stored in the
following vectors:

```
length <- c(2.2, 2.1, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 2.5, 1.9, 1.1, 3.5, 2.9)
width <- c(1.3, 2.2, 1.5, 4.5, 3.1, 2.8, 1.8, 0.5, 2.0, 2.7)
height <- c(9.6, 7.6, 2.2, 1.5, 4.0, 3.0, 4.5, 2.3, 7.5, 3.2)
```

Copy these vectors into an R script and then determine the following:

1. The volume of each shrub (i.e., the length times the width times the height)
2. The total volume of all of the shrubs
3. A vector of the height of shrubs with lengths greater than 2.5
