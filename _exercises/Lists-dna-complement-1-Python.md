Write a function that returns the complement of an arbitrary DNA strand
passed as a string. The complement of a DNA strand is that strand with
A's replaced by T's, T's replaced by A's, G's replaced by C's, and C's
replaced by G's. E.g., the complement of 'attgcga' is 'taacgct'. Use
this function in combation with a for loop to determine the complement
of the following strands of DNA (included in a list that can be pasted
into your code) and print the complements to the screen.

```
sequences = ['GCCATTCTGC', 'GCTTACCCAA', 'CCTCTAGCGC', 'TAAATTTTGT',
'TGTGATACTG', 'AACAGAGCATCTCTTGTGACCAGTT', 'TAGGCTGCCTGTGGCAGGTTGTTGCATTCTCTTAGAACCGCCCTGAACTC', 'ATCCACAGACATCTCGTGTAAGGGG', 'CCCTCTTTCCAATTGACAGGATCAG']
```
