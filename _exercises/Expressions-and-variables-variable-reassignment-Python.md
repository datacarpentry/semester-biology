Using a single variable convert a temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit
to Celsius. To do this you'll need to:

1.  Assign the number 42 to a variable
2.  Subtract 32 from it and assign that value back to the same variable
3.  Divide the current value by 9 and assign that value back to the same
    variable
4.  And then multiple the current value by 5 and assign that value back
    to the same variable
5.  Print the temperature in degrees Celsius

The answer should be 5.55555. If it isn't then that pesky [integer
division](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/weecology/progbio/raw/master/ipynbs/integer-division.ipynb)
problem is probably tripping you up.

Now do the same thing again, but this time using combined operators, and
a starting temperature of 98.6 degrees.
