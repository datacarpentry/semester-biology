Use the built-in character functions `tolower` and `toupper` to manipulate and print the following string.

1. `"species"` in all capital letters
2. `"SPECIES"` in all lower case letters

*There are other built-in character functions in R, but they are surprisingly clunky and difficult to use. Lucky for us, someone else thought so too and built a package called `stringr`, that we introduce next.*
