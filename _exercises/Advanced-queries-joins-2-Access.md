You are curious about what other kinds of animals get caught in the Sherman
traps used to census the rodents. Write a query that returns a list of the
scientific names and Taxa (from the species table) for non-rodent individuals
that are caught on the control plots. None rodents are indicated by a zero in
the `rodent` column of the `species` table. You are only interested in which
species are captured, so make this list unique (only one line for each
species). Save this query as `Non-rodents On Controls`.
