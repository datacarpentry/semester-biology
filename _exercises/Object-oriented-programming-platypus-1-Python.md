We're experimenting with platypus (platypi?). During the breeding
season, each platypus will lay a certain number of eggs. We want to
model the platypus and keep track of how many eggs they've laid each
season.

Design a class, Platypus, that takes the name of the platypus and a list
containing the number of eggs laid each season. For example,

```
>>> perry = Platypus("perry", [3, 2, 4, 1, 2])\
>>> perry.name
"perry"
...
```
